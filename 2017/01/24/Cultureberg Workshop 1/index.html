<!-- Content -->
<p>On 24 January 2017 (week 2), we had a workshop we discussed the theme topic of our design with data research, and during the workshop, we tried to narrow the topic down to a subtopic. Firstly the lecturer introduces the four level of the iceberg, which are Litany, systemic causes, Worldview, and Myth &amp; Metaphor. our topics were around Food and pollution and the relation between them. In the first part, we divided our topics into subtopics like food packaging, Vegan &amp; vegetarian consumers, Organic Food transport &amp; shipment and last but not least Organic fuel. In the second phase, we tried to research and find stakeholders which are people or organizations who are contributed to this topic, for instance, shipment companies, supermarket, farmers, and consumers. Moreover, we tried to find their angle view of the problem. By the end of the workshop, we discuss the Myth &amp; Metaphorical says around this topic such as you are what you eat, then we stuck our result of the three phases on the wall.</p>
<p>During the first week of workshop that called cultureberg, we took through a process of deconstructing the situation that related to food, transport and environment. At first we connected the subtheme with newspaper and tried to find the common point, which almost indicated the organic food is an import role. Then we proposed several stakeholders such as farmer, supermarket, consumers, Shipment Company, nutritionist and media. The relationship was also connected and analyzed beyond stakeholders. We picked up four most powerful correlations that involves famer, supermarket, consumers and Shipment Company. At the end of the workshop, we also discussed the Myth &amp; Metaphorical from the fragment that we got. It’s not easy to construct the content from deep meaning of the topic, but we tried our best.</p>
<p>On 24 Jan, we had a Design with data course. in this course, the tutor lead us went though the whole innovation is driven reveal iceberg research process to find the opportunities and ideas.<br>Firstly we did the litany. basically. It makes us decide the topic we wish to look deeper. Then, it’s the systemic causes, which we find the industries which are relevant to the topic also the interrelationships between these industries. After that, we come up some industry interests or what was in their mind, that was named as the worldview. Finally, is the myth and metaphor. This lets us find the myth from existing industry world.<br>After all these processes, I find I totally understand the industry, which all related to the money. Basically, I found out that all industries simply work for their own interests.</p>
